	VQFP100		ZIP28		ZIP60_MOT	ZIP64_MOT			
	The package dimensions of all the above symbols are in accordance with the
	JEDEC-95 standards. In cases of symbols which were not found in the JEDEC
	document, a manufacturer suffix has been added to distinguish them. Hence
	the CQFP208_ALT package is from the Altera package data. When JEDEC comes
	up with specifications for these packages, the symbols will be updated to
	conform to that specification.

	- The following new pads have been added.

	PGA_SQ		SMD110REC19	SMD110REC23	SMD30_57	SMD30_96

	SMD30REC14	SMD36REC12	SMD50REC12	SMD50REC19	SMD60REC19

	SMD90REC19	SOJ

	- All the quad flat packages have been assumed to be used with an L bend
	  for the pins. The pad sizes for these symbols have been calculated based
	  on this assumption. The pad sizes for the rest of the new symbols are
	  in accordance with ANSI/IPC-SM782A recommendations.

	- All the PGA symbols have been updated so that it shows the correct NC
	  drill figure.

	- The origin in case of all Surface Mount symbols has been changed to be
	  at the center of the package. This enables easy mirroring of packages to
	  the bottom side of the pc-board. The origin in case of PGA pads, has been
	  fixed at Pin 1.

	- The pin row O has been changed to P in case of PGA132.

10-04-93  ldang/pk  : Release 8.0 P1
         This is the first release of the complete Allegro symbol library.

         - The following symbols hve been created to be in accordance with

        - The following allegro shapes represent diodes and transistors which
          get fixed to the board, while the anode or the base and the emitter
          is on the top of the device ( not in the same plane as that of the
          board ). Since Allegro requires pads for all pins on the symbol to
          be shown on the same plane, certain pins of these symbols are not
          shown. These symbols are to be modified according to the customer's
          requirements.

	  library.
